## Synopsis

The dotfiles script automates several tasks. Downloading of frequently used tools, updating shell configuration scripts (e.g. .bashrc, .profile, et cetera) and much more

## Motivation

Everytime I have a fresh linux installation (e.g. Ubuntu) I find that I spend quite a few hours trying to tweak and reconfigure the system to my own needs. With the 'dotfiles' scripts I try to automate the most of these tasks.

## Installation

### Ubuntu Notes

* You need to be an administrator (for `sudo`).
* You need to have 'curl' installed (`apt-get install curl`)

### Actual Installation

```sh
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://bit.ly/qn-dotfiles)" && source ~/.bashrc
```

If, for some reason, [bit.ly](https://bit.ly/) is down, you can use the canonical URL.

```sh
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/qnimbus/dotfiles/master/bin/install.sh)" && source ~/.bashrc
```

## Post-installation tasks

Keep in mind that some config files need to be configured to your personal settings. For example the `.gitconfig` file in the users homedir needs to have a username and an e-mail address added to it.
